# üó∫Ô∏è Apache Aegis Project Roadmap (Year 1)

This roadmap provides a month-by-month breakdown of goals and deliverables for Apache Aegis (Incubating).

---

## üéØ Vision
Build a **Dual Validation Security Framework** capable of verifying every binary, configuration, and system mutation with cryptographic and human attestation ‚Äî preventing unauthorized modifications across clusters, containers, and devices.

---

## üìÖ Month-by-Month Deliverables

### **Month 1 ‚Äì Project Bootstrap**
- [x] Initialize GitHub repository with Apache License 2.0  
- [x] Create core docs: README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, ROADMAP  
- [x] Define initial module structure (API, Agent, Ledger, Policy, CLI)  
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions or Jenkins)  
- [ ] Basic FastAPI prototype for change-request + approval flow  

---

### **Month 2 ‚Äì Core API & Schema**
- [ ] Implement REST endpoints for:
  - `POST /change-requests`
  - `POST /approve`
  - `GET /ledger/audit`
- [ ] Integrate PostgreSQL for change request persistence  
- [ ] Add unit + integration tests for dual-validation workflow  
- [ ] Add OpenAPI spec generation + Swagger docs  

---

### **Month 3 ‚Äì Agent Development**
- [ ] Build file watcher daemon (Rust/Go) using fanotify / eBPF hooks  
- [ ] Implement hash + signature validation logic  
- [ ] Secure communication channel (mTLS) with Aegis API  
- [ ] Basic quarantine mechanism for unauthorized file modifications  

---

### **Month 4 ‚Äì Ledger & Policy Engine**
- [ ] Design Merkle-tree based audit ledger  
- [ ] Implement ledger append, verify, and query functions  
- [ ] Integrate Open Policy Agent (OPA) for Rego-based policy enforcement  
- [ ] Prototype policy: ‚ÄúRequire 2 human approvals for OS-level binaries‚Äù  

---

### **Month 5 ‚Äì CLI Tools & Integration**
- [ ] Develop `aegisctl` CLI (Python) for request submission and approval  
- [ ] Add CLI command for ‚Äúledger verify‚Äù and ‚Äúpolicy test‚Äù  
- [ ] Integrate with GitHub Actions for automated binary validation pre-merge  
- [ ] Create Docker container for self-contained Aegis demo  

---

### **Month 6 ‚Äì Threat Simulation & Testing**
- [ ] Simulate attacks: trojan injection, ransomware, botnet binary drops  
- [ ] Verify Aegis response accuracy and latency  
- [ ] Integrate malware hash feeds (VirusTotal API, MISP, or internal DB)  
- [ ] Publish initial ‚ÄúDual Validation vs Attack Vectors‚Äù whitepaper  

---

### **Month 7 ‚Äì Distributed Ledger Prototype**
- [ ] Implement P2P sync between multiple Aegis nodes (gRPC or libp2p)  
- [ ] Add hash transparency proofs for audit trails  
- [ ] Implement replay protection and ledger snapshot export  

---

### **Month 8 ‚Äì Android & Container Extensions**
- [ ] Build Android proof-of-concept (APK signature and system integrity checks)  
- [ ] Add Kubernetes admission controller for container image validation  
- [ ] Publish results on performance and usability  

---

### **Month 9 ‚Äì Enterprise Security Integration**
- [ ] Integrate with LDAP / Kerberos for user auth  
- [ ] Support external PKI and Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)  
- [ ] Export audit logs to SIEM (Splunk / ELK / OpenSearch)  

---

### **Month 10 ‚Äì Advanced Threat Modules**
- [ ] Add behavioral rules for detecting:
  - Worms, trojans, ransomware
  - Mimikatz / credential dumpers
  - DNS tunneling attempts  
- [ ] Implement auto-lock policy on anomalous file mutation spikes  

---

### **Month 11 ‚Äì Performance & Scaling**
- [ ] Benchmark Aegis API under 100k+ validation requests/day  
- [ ] Optimize ledger write and hash verification performance  
- [ ] Introduce caching layer (Redis / RocksDB) for artifact checks  

---

### **Month 12 ‚Äì Release & Incubator Handoff**
- [ ] Finalize v1.0 release candidate  
- [ ] Complete Apache Incubator audit checklist  
- [ ] Publish documentation and onboarding guide  
- [ ] Present to Apache Incubator PMC for graduation consideration  

---

## üß© Long-Term Vision (Post Year 1)
- [ ] Build **Global Binary Cache Network** ‚Äî distributed registry of verified binaries and signatures.  
- [ ] Introduce **AI-based anomaly detection** for malicious change patterns.  
- [ ] Provide **firmware and BIOS validation hooks** (UEFI integration).  
- [ ] Expand to **cloud-native plugins** for AWS, GCP, Azure.  
- [ ] Establish **Aegis Alliance** ‚Äî global transparency log consortium.  

---

## üìà Milestone Metrics
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Mean Time to Detection (MTTD) | < 10 seconds per unauthorized change |
| Approval Workflow Latency | < 3 minutes end-to-end |
| Ledger Verification Performance | < 100 ms per query |
| Coverage of Attack Classes | ‚â• 95% of file-based attack vectors |
